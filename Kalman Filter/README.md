### Model Specification

A particle . We periodically observe noisy measurements of its location, and want to estimate the true location of the particle.

### Findings

Details of my findings can be found in [KalmanFilter.ipynb](https://github.com/DMarke99/Machine-Learning-Gym/blob/master/Kalman%20Filter/KalmanFilter.ipynb). The notebook can be rendered at the [following link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DMarke99/Machine-Learning-Gym/blob/master/Kalman%20Filter/KalmanFilter.ipynb).

### Implementation

Code is implemented in Python 3, optimised using Numba and Numpy.
